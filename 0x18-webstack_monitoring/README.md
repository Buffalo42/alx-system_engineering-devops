# Webstack Monitoring Project

## Introduction
This project focuses on implementing web stack monitoring for server and application health. Monitoring is crucial in the tech industry as it allows us to measure and improve system performance.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of server and application monitoring, including the importance of monitoring, the types of data collected, and how to interpret logs for analysis.

## Concepts Covered
- **Monitoring**: The process of observing and collecting data about the performance and health of a system.
- **Server Monitoring**: Gathering data about the physical or virtual servers to ensure they are operating optimally.
- **Application Monitoring**: Collecting data about running software to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Access Logs**: Records of all requests made to a web server, providing insights into who accessed the server and when.
- **Error Logs**: Logs that capture information about errors encountered by the web server, aiding in troubleshooting and debugging.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completing this project, you should be able to:
- Explain the importance of monitoring in the tech industry.
- Differentiate between server and application monitoring.
- Describe the purpose and contents of access logs and error logs for a web server like Nginx.

## Resources

## Requirements
- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation Environment**: Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
- **File Structure**: All files should end with a new line, and a README.md file at the root of the folder is mandatory.
- **Bash Scripts**: All Bash script files must be executable and pass Shellcheck (version 0.3.7) without any error.
- **Script Documentation**: The first line of all Bash scripts should be `#!/usr/bin/env bash`, followed by a comment explaining the script's purpose.
