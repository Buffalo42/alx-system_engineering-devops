# Project Title: Python Scripting for API Data Manipulation

## Overview
This project focuses on utilizing Python scripting to interact with an API, specifically to organize and export employee data into different data structures. The traditional approach of using Bash scripting for such tasks is highlighted as inefficient, thus Python is proposed as a more suitable alternative.

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:
- The limitations of Bash scripting for certain tasks.
- Understanding of APIs, including REST APIs and their significance in modern software development.
- Knowledge of microservices and their role in building scalable applications.
- Familiarity with data serialization formats such as CSV and JSON.
- Adherence to Python coding standards, including style guides for package, module, class, variable, function, and constant naming conventions.
- Understanding the significance of CamelCase naming in Python.

## Resources
To aid in your understanding and completion of this project, consider referring to the following resources:
- ["Friends donâ€™t let friends program in shell script"](https://blog.startifact.com/posts/overview-of-pythonic-code-with-examples/)

- [What are microservices?](https://microservices.io/)
- [PEP8 Python style guide](https://pep8.org/)

## Requirements
### General
- **Allowed editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpretation/Compilation:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.8.5
- **File endings:** All files should end with a new line
- **Shebang line:** The first line of all files should be `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Library organization:** Import statements should be alphabetically ordered
- **README.md:** A mandatory file providing project overview and instructions
- **Coding style:** Use pycodestyle (version 2.8.*) for adherence to Python style guidelines
- **File execution:** All files must be executable
- **File length:** Length of files will be tested using `wc`
- **Documentation:** All modules should have documentation accessible using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`
- **Dictionary access:** Utilize `get()` method to access dictionary values
- **Import execution:** Code should not execute when imported (`if __name__ == "__main__":`)
