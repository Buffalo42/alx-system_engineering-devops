Project Title: HTTPS SSL Security Project

Overview: This project aims to enhance understanding and implementation of HTTPS SSL
security measures. It covers the basics of HTTPS SSL, its main roles, the purpose of
encrypting traffic, and SSL termination. By the end of this project, participants
should be able to explain these concepts without external assistance.
