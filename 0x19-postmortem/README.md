# WEB APPLICATION AUTHENTICATION SERVICE POSTMORTEM

## Issue Summary

**Duration:** The outage occurred on May 12, 2024, starting at 10:00 AM UTC and lasted for approximately 4 hours, ending at 2:00 PM UTC.  
**Impact:** The outage affected the web applicationâ€™s authentication service, rendering it inaccessible for all users attempting to log in. This resulted in a complete service disruption, impacting 100% of users who attempted to access the application during the outage period.

## Timeline

- **10:00 AM UTC:** The issue was detected through automated monitoring alerts, indicating a sudden spike in failed authentication attempts.
- **10:05 AM UTC:** Engineers began investigating the issue, initially focusing on potential database connection issues as the root cause.
- **11:00 AM UTC:** After ruling out database connectivity issues, attention shifted towards examining recent code deployments for potential bugs or misconfigurations.
- **12:30 PM UTC:** Further investigation revealed that a recent code update inadvertently introduced a critical logic error within the authentication module.
- **1:00 PM UTC:** The incident was escalated to the development team for immediate resolution.
- **2:00 PM UTC:** The issue was resolved by rolling back the faulty code update to the previous stable version, restoring normal functionality to the authentication service.

## Root Cause and Resolution

**Root Cause:** The root cause of the outage was identified as a logic error introduced during a recent code deployment. Specifically, a conditional statement within the authentication module was incorrectly configured, causing it to fail under certain conditions.  
**Resolution:** To resolve the issue, the faulty code update was rolled back to the previous stable version. Additionally, comprehensive unit and integration tests were conducted to ensure the integrity of the authentication module before re-deployment.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements/Fixes
- Implement stricter code review processes to catch logic errors before deployment.
- Enhance monitoring capabilities to detect similar issues in real-time.

### Tasks to Address the Issue
- Conduct a thorough review of the codebase to identify and rectify any existing logic errors.
- Implement automated testing pipelines to validate code changes before deployment.
- Enhance documentation and communication channels to facilitate more efficient incident response and escalation procedures.

By implementing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to minimize the likelihood of similar outages occurring in the future while enhancing the overall reliability and stability of our web application.
